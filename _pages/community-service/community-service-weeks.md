## Join Our "Community Service Week" Activities. Think Globally, Serve Locally!

**The Washington Center for International Education (WCIE)**, a Washington, D.C.-based non-profit 501(c)(3) organization, is happy to announce Community Service Week--a week to bring us together for engaging programs serving our community--September 10-19, 2021. WCIE organizes community service programs in collaboration with **English Now!**, an English school located in Bethesda, Maryland. English Now! will serve as the co-sponsor of Community Service Week.

WCIE and English Now! have organized Community Service Weeks twice a year since 2016. Our goals for this effort are to connect the area's international and local communities, inspire community engagement, and mobilize volunteers to support local organizations doing great work in the community. **Let’s think globally and serve & engage locally, together!**

This September's Community Service Week activities will focus on three areas:

* helping neighbors in need through a [food and household goods drive](/community-service/household-goods-and-food-drive),
* [fighting racism](/community-service/walk-and-talk-against-racism), and
* [serving refugee families](/community-service/refugee-resettlement) as they arrive in the area.

WCIE and English Now! are pleased to partner with local organizations including MCAEL, the International Rescue Committee (IRC), Community Reach of Montgomery County, Identity, Inc., September House MAJ, THIS for Diplomats, the Connie Morella (Bethesda) Library, and more for Community Service Week. WCIE and English Now! are happy that Community Service Week coincides with this fall's [**Welcoming Week**](https://welcomingamerica.org/initiatives/welcoming-week/).

**GET INVOLVED.** We invite you to learn more about community service and connect with others at a **COMMUNITY SERVICE FAIR & ICE CREAM SOCIAL**, on Friday, September 17, 4:00-6:00pm, at the Caroline Freeland Urban Park, 7200 Arlington Rd, Bethesda, MD 20814. Learn about organizations doing great work in the community and enjoy some ice cream. Open to all-international and local residents of the area, and bring friends and family. We hope to see you there!
