Refugees are people whose lives have been upended by war, conflict and natural disasters. They are resettled around the world through a global effort coordinated by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

### Support for IRC Programs

**Think globally, serve locally.** We are delighted to support the efforts of the [International Rescue Committee](https://www.rescue.org/) (IRC), headquartered in Silver Spring, Maryland, to resettle refugees in the Washington, D.C. area. We are organizing groups that will participate in the IRC's [Welcome Home program](https://www.rescue.org/volunteer/refugee-welcome-home-project-volunteer) to furnish apartments for newly-arrived refugee families. Participate in one of [the IRC's monthly webinars](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScmJUvE_Pa7ZjZI5R6ATvLj9XnXKvRB6U889IdIMWyFjYN5kg/viewform) to learn more about this great program.

In addition, furniture and household goods collected in our <a href="/community-service/household-goods-and-food-drive">Community Service Week Donation Drive</a> will be used to set up apartments for refugees being resettled locally by the IRC. We also anticipate a continuing need for furniture and household items after Community Service Week. Let us know any time if you have gently used items that might be well used by a refugee family in the area.

### Other Initiatives

Students learn about issues related to refugee resettlement in our Student Service Learning Program, [Youth Facing the Global Refugee & Migration Crisis](https://washingtoncie.org/student-service-learning/youth-facing-the-global-refugee-and-migration-crisis); and our partner English Now! offers scholarships to locally-resettled refugees for English language study, to help them and their families thrive in their transitions to life in the United States.
