## Support Our ESOL Programs for Refugees

We are teaching over 40 refugee students. These students are studying in small group classes of four students maximum, taught by professional, experienced ESOL instructors.

## Volunteer

Our activities and programs require volunteer support. Please let us know if you may be interested in supporting one of our programs (for students, parents, or educators), and we will be glad to update you about current and future events. (NOTE: Volunteers in some community service programs that involve direct engagement with youth require a background check, and those volunteers must also provide references.)

## Teach in Our ESOL Programs for Refugees

WCIE is organizing classes to respond to the considerable needs for English language education on the part of Afghan evacuees as well as other refugees. Working with partners like the International Rescue Committee and the International Association of Women Judges (IAWJ), our programs are distinctive, high-impact, and professionally organized and managed.

Recently-resettled refugees benefit from personal attention in WCIE programs that can make a tremendous difference in their transition to life in the U.S. Classes are small–four students maximum online or six students maximum in-person–and teachers are professional educators with significant experience–and are compensated for their work.

Are you an ESOL professional with significant teaching experience and a passion for serving refugees? Consider joining [our team](/team). [Contact us](/contact) for more information about our programs, and we would be happy to tell you about the profiles of our current class offerings and any teaching needs.

## Core Support

We’d love to talk to you about your vision for internationally-oriented education and service programs, as well as ways to serve refugees, and we’re open to deep collaboration with individuals and organizations.
